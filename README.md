Warm-up.Original.Slope1 code has been associated to find a feasible solution of the underdetermined linear system equations with bounded variables, that is,
find v
s.t. Sv=0,
     l_1<v<u_1.
Please set your file name, your sheet and your data range for matrix S on lines 7-9.
Please set  your data range for lower bound vector l_1 on the line 17.
Please set  your data range for lower bound vector u_1 on the line 23.
